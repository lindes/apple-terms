Apple TOS repo
==============

This repository is meant to record history of the various Terms and
Conditions and related documents that Apple has, so that differences can
be seen between versions.

Normally, Apple presents you with the entire document, and it's hard to
know whether there are material changes, and where they are.  With this,
it should be much easier by way of looking at git diffs.

## Caveats and other notes:

- This is not meant to be an exhaustive set of all of these sorts of
  documents.  I'm recording the ones I'm paying attention to, and that's
  definitely only a subset.  I may try to add more in the future.

- I created this repository on 2016-10-12, but I backfilled some of the
  documents with data that I'd had from e-mails sent to me by Apple when
  I requested the terms be sent via their iOS update UI.  So there's
  a bit of extra history there, even though it's got a 2016 date on it.

- I probably ought to be doing GPG-signed tags to testify that these
  terms are what I had as of a particular date.  I'm being lasy and
  using unsigned tags.  I could probably be convinced to do otherwise.

- I make no promise about having the latest versions here, or of
  recording every change that happens here, even for the documents I pay
  attention to.  I'll endeavor to keep reasonably current, but it's
  certainly possible that I'll fall behind, and it's also possible that
  multiple changes will have been made between my updates, so that an
  intermediate state will have been lost/invisible to this record.

- This repository was created and is being maintained by David Lindes.
  Feel free to fork it, though it'd be nice if you'd change this line to
  reference any other maintainer(s).
